# Data-Scientists-Salaries-Analysis

Brief description:
An analysis done on salaries of data scientists throughout the world.

Introduction:
Data Science and related fields have become the most sexiest job in the 21st century.
There has been a heavy increase of awareness of data science and big data related jobs throughout the world.
This project illustrates the salaries of data scientists throughout the world through five graphical charts.

Charts Used:
In this project, I have used 5 charts which illustrate the distribution of salaries of data scientists. They are:

1. A bar chart denoting the salaries of data scientists based on company's location.
2. A bubble chart showing the salaries of data scientists by role.
3. A pyramid chart denoting the relationship between the salary and the experience of data scientists.
4. A line chart denoting the trend of salaries of data scientists in various years (from 2020 to 2023).
5. A pie chart denoting the relationship between the size of companies and average salaries.

Results:
1. From the bar chart, it is known that the data science companies located in the USA pay the highest salary for a data scientist, with Canada, Australia, UK and Germany being the next highest.
2. From the bubble chart, it is known that a data engineer has the highest salary paid in the data science industry.
3. From the pyramid chart, the salary of a data scientist increases with more experience.
4. The salaries paid to a data scientist is rising after every completed year (from 2020 to 2023), indicating the growth of the data science industry.
5. There doesn't seem to be a difference between the amount of average salaries paid by small, medium and large companies.

Conclusion:

From these charts, we can infer that the data science industry is growing and more youngsters could think about this industry for pursuing their career.
